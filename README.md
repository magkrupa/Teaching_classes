# Protein Analysis Classes

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a class about protein analysis using Biopython. The notebook guides students through the process of analyzing protein sequences, structures, and other aspects using Python and several scientific libraries.
What You'll Learn

In these classes, you'll:

    - Understand the fundamental aspects of proteins, their structures and sequences.
    - Learn to use Biopython, a set of freely available tools for biological computation.
    - Understand how to manipulate and analyze protein sequences.
    - Learn how to explore protein structures using PDB files.

## Prerequisites

Before starting these classes, you should be familiar with Python. Some understanding of biology and protein structures is helpful, but not required.
Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, you can open and run the Jupyter notebook.

git clone https://github.com/magkrupa/Teaching_classes.git \
cd Teaching_classes \
